# Breast Cancer Dataset

This dataset contains data on breast cancer cases in Southern Nigeria collected from the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital's cancer registry over a 24-month period from January 2019 to August 2021. It includes 213 observations and 11 features.

## Background

Breast cancer continues to pose a significant threat to female populations globally, particularly in underdeveloped regions such as Southern Nigeria. The scarcity of indigenous breast cancer data presents a hindrance to the development of effective prediction systems, as the majority of cases reported in these areas are often in advanced stages. The purpose of this dataset is to provide researchers with a source of information on breast cancer cases in Southern Nigeria, which is an underrepresented region in terms of breast cancer data.

## Data Collection

The data were collected following the ethical guidelines of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH), and the relevant ethical committee approval was obtained before data collection. The study involved human subjects, and all participants provided informed consent before collecting their data. The study was conducted per the Declaration of Helsinki. The data collected and analyzed in this publication were de-identified to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the participants.

## Contents

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- S/N: Unique identification for each patient
- Year: The year diagnosis was conducted
- Age: Age of the patient at the time of diagnosis
- Menopause: Whether the patient was pre- or post-menopausal at the time of diagnosis
- Tumor size: The size in centimeters of the excised tumor
- Inverse nodes: The number of axillary lymph nodes that contained metastatic cancer
- Breast: The side of the body affected (left or right)
- Metastatic: Whether the cancer had spread to other parts of the body or organs
- Breast quadrant: The section of the gland in which the cancer was located, with the nipple as a central point
- History: Whether the patient had a personal or family history of cancer
- Diagnosis result: The final diagnosis of the breast cancer dataset.


## Potential Uses

This dataset holds potential for improved exploration, classification, and detection of breast cancer using machine learning techniques and advanced statistical methods. The integration of image data in the analysis would further enhance the accuracy of breast cancer detection. Researchers, healthcare providers, and public health organizations can benefit from these data by using them to better understand the incidence and characteristics of breast cancer in this population.
